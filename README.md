# Introduction
This project is for my university android development course. The idea is to make an application where a teacher can upload class content. Students from that particular course can view or download that content(like LMS). Students also can see notices from the teacher and holiday calendar view.
# Feature List
- login as student/teacher
- course list
- course content
- notice board
- holiday view
